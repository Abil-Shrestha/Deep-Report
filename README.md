- **Modern Architecture**: Utilizes Next.js SSR and React Server Components for optimal performance.
- **TypeScript**: Strict type safety for robust code.
- **Optimized UI/UX**: Responsive design with Tailwind CSS and modern components.
- **Efficient State Management**: Leverages modern solutions like Zustand or TanStack React Query.
- **Optimized Images**: Utilizes WebP image format, lazy loading, and responsive design.
- **Security & Error Handling**: Robust error boundaries and custom validations with Zod.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (React, SSR, RSC), Tailwind CSS, Shadcn UI
- **Backend**: API routes in Next.js with server-side logic
- **State Management**: Zustand / TanStack React Query 
- **Validation**: Zod
- **Package Manager**: Bun
