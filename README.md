# STORM: Structured Topic Organization and Research Method

> Implementation of the STORM algorithm described in ["Assisting in Writing Wikipedia-like Articles From Scratch with Large Language Models"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14207) (arXiv, 2024)

STORM is an advanced Python-based algorithm that implements a sophisticated approach to web research and content analysis. It combines multiple AI models and search APIs to generate comprehensive, well-structured research outlines with source attribution, following the methodology outlined in the research paper.

## üéØ Overview

STORM helps researchers and content creators by:
1. Generating related topics for deeper exploration
2. Performing intelligent web searches
3. Analyzing and structuring content
4. Creating detailed outlines with source attribution
5. Managing research conversations and perspectives
